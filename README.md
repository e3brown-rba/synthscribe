# SynthScribe

AI-powered content generation tool leveraging advanced prompt engineering techniques for scalable, high-quality output.

## Overview

SynthScribe demonstrates practical implementation of LLM optimization strategies, built from experience managing AI systems at Amazon scale. The tool focuses on prompt engineering best practices, quality validation, and automated feedback loops.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Prompt Engineering**: Sophisticated framework for prompt optimization and validation
- **Quality Threshold Management**: Automated systems for evaluating and improving AI output quality
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed for handling high-volume content generation workflows
- **Feedback Loop Integration**: Built-in mechanisms for continuous model performance improvement

## Technical Approach

- Multi-model compatibility (GPT, Claude, Amazon Nova)
- Python-based automation and data processing
- Quality scoring and batch reprocessing capabilities
- Integration with existing content management workflows

## Background

This project applies lessons learned from implementing prompt engineering frameworks for billions of products, focusing on practical business applications rather than experimental features.
